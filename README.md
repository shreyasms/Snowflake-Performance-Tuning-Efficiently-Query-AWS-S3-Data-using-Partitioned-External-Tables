# Snowflake-Performance-Tuning-Efficiently-Query-AWS-S3-Data-using-Partitioned-External-Tables

In this repository we will discuss about the one of the Snowflake Performance Tuning method while accessing the data over Data Lake(AWS S3) effectively by using the External Tables with Partition enabled.

You will learn:

·        Creating the External Storage (AWS S3) & create the partition folder structures.
·        Enabling secured connection between Snowflake & AWS S3.
·        Creating External Tables (holds external stage metadata info) with automated refresh process.

At the end will write some SQL query and execute it using WITH & WITHOUT Partitioned External Tables to see the performance improvement of the SQL query.

The details about the flow and execution process has been explained in the below Medium Blog.
